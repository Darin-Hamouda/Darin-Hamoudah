- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a Frontend developer.
- ðŸ”­ I worked as a lecturer for 15 years, and now it is time for programming.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I recently moved to Belgium and I can't speak dutch nor Frans yet. ( so I'll be learning a new human language beside a new programming language :metal:)
